    "# Basic Python and Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "The tools we are going to use this semester to analyze data are in Python, a very beginner friendly programming language. Never coded before? Been a while? These basics will go a long way to helping you understand how this all works. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with Jupyter Notebooks. Jupyter is a basic coding environment that doesn't require extra software to work in beyond installing Jupyter Notebooks, which you've already done. It works in a browser, is interactive, and better yet, you can document what you are doing. So let's try that first. In the next cell, type `print(\"Hello World\")` and then either hold shift and press return or click the button to the left of the button with the big black square on it -- the one with the triangle pointed at a line. Either way, you've run your code and should see Hello World printed out below your cell. Congrats. You just ran your first line of Python."

    "But let's do more. We can annotate each step of our process here in our own words. To do that, we need more cells to work with. So click into the cell where you ran your Hello World step and go up to the tool bar and click Insert > Insert Cell Above. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now click into that cell and go up to Cell > Cell Type > Markdown. That will change the cell from one that excutes Python to one that renders Markdown, a simple markup language where you can do basic things like **bold text** or [add links](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) to text. This whole document uses Markdown to render text. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice when you changed it to markdown the In [X]: bits went away. That's your clue that your cell no longer executes code but now will just display text in Markdown. So in that cell, type `# I have made fire` and hit shift enter or click the run button. What do you get? \n",
    "\n",
    "As silly as it is as an example, it's an important one. You will create Markdown cells every time you execute code and use it to explain what you did. In this case, we just used Python's print function to print some words. We can change Hello World to whatever we want and Python will print it to the screen. That's what print does.\n",

    "# Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "One of your first lesssons is to not make things more complicated than you need. \n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are the first place you get to test this lesson. A variable is a name given to something you store. It can be a name, a number, a list of things. It can be a whole database. If it can be found in a computer, you can make it a variable. You can name variables anything you like, but best practice is to name it whatever it is. So if it's a place to store names, call it name. If it's a place to store an age, make it age. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the equal sign is the symbol to assign variables to a name. So, for instance, if you see `myname = \"Matt\"` that means I've assigned the value \"Matt\" to the variable name myname. Notice how Matt is in quotes? That tells Python what this variable is. Words -- called strings in Python -- are in quotes. Numbers are not. It's just that simple. \n",
    "\n",
    "So let's create a variable. Call it firstname and assign your first name to it, just like I did above with myname. Then, when you've created your variable and told it what your first name is, print it like `print(firstname)`. Be sure to run the command -- shift enter -- after you have put your code in. "

    "So let's play a little. You can use variables to plug in words in a sentence using something called substitution. So create a variable called age and assign it the value of your age. REMEMBER: Numbers don't have quotes around them. \n",
    "\n",
    "The way to use substitution is a little tricky at first, but once you can read it, it gets very easy. To substitute a word, you use `%s`. To substitute a number without a decimal point, called an integer, you use `%i`. So if I wanted to write a sentence that said how old I am using Python and variables, I would write `print(\"%s %s is %i years old\" % (firstname, lastname, age))`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's unpack that a bit. `print()` is a function -- we'll get into that later -- that prints things. Simple. Inside the parenthesis is what gets printed. So the next parts -- `\"%s %s is %i years old\"` is the string, with the substitutions in place. They're just placeholders that python will switch out. The `%` after the quote mark is us telling python that the substitutions are as follows, and then we give it a list of them in parentheses. \n",

    "First, a list. A list is a simple data structure in Python. It looks like this: `mylist = [1,2,3,4,5]`. The brackets tell Python this is a list. You can store anything in a list. It doesn't have to be all one thing, either. You can have a list like `mymess = [1,2,\"Hair\",4,\"Zebras\"]` and Python thinks that's a fine list. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can do powerful things with lists, but the first thing you have to understand about lists is this: Python starts a count with 0. So 0 is the first element in the list, 1 is the second, and so forth. We can slice a list by position like `mylist[0]`, which gives us the first number in the list. If you ran this, you'd get 1, which is the first number in the list. If you ran `mylist[1]` you'd get 2. It's frustrating at first, but you get used to it.\n",

    "# Functions and methods\n",
    "\n",
    "A function in Python is a bit of code that does a thing. The function almost always takes input, and almost always produces output. Some functions are part of libraries that you can import into your program and use. Some functions you create yourself based on your needs. Methods are often functions, but they are attached to a class of object. A simple example: A string is a class of object. Strings have methods attached to them because they belong to this class. \n",
    "\n",
    "An example is handy. Let's say we have a list of names. And we are angry with every person on the list. We want to print their names out to the screen in upper case letters without having to retype the names. Well, conveniently, we have a method on strings called uppper that we can use. \n",

    "You've already used a function -- print. Generally, functions come before the object -- the object is inside parenthesis, so as to be acted upon. Let's give a silly example of a function we create. You would never do this -- it's silly and can be done much easier with different code, but it'll show you everything going on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go back to `mylist`. Let's say we want to double each number in the list and we don't know you can just do that in a loop. We think we need to make it a function. So to do that, we first have to define the function -- using `def` -- and return the number. Here's an overly verbose example:\n",

    "```\n",

    "    newnumber = number * 2\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note in the define step, we define the function, give it a name (double in this case) and then in the parentheses, we tell the function to expect a variable called number. We can name the function anything. And we can tell it to expect a variable called anything we want. We could call the function nebraska and the variable superman if we wanted to. It does not matter. But, the smart programmer names things for what they are. It makes it easier to come back to later. \n",
