__Course description:__  

Every day, more of our lives is being stored in a database somewhere. With that explosion of data, journalists now more than ever need the skills to analyze and understand data to then produce the stories hidden in the information. In this class, we’ll use brainpower and software to look at raw data -- not summarized and already reported information -- to do investigative reporting. We’re going to get our hands dirty with code, data, basic stats and the thinking that goes with it. And we're going to do journalism. So buckle up and hold on.

__Prerequisites:__

JOUR202. JOUR302/304 or 370 is strongly encouraged.

__Course goals:__  

* Understand the basics of data and data journalism, including the history of the practice
* Master the use of data in journalistic storytelling
* Master basic data analysis for storytelling
* Use public records laws and understand your rights as a citizen and a journalist
* Master the use of analysis libraries and the tools of transparency for data journalism.

__Required Materials:__  

* A functioning laptop computer that you must bring with you to class every time and ~800 MB of free hard drive space.
* The administrative privileges to install software on your computer.
* [The Data Journalism Handbook](http://datajournalismhandbook.org/) Free!
* A copy of [Numbers in the Newsroom](http://store.ire.org/products/numbers-in-the-newsroom-using-math-and-statistics-in-news-second-edition-e-version). $10.
* A copy of Data Literacy: A Users's Guide by David Herzog. Available in the bookstore.
* Online materials and class handouts, as needed.
* A sense of humor.

__Grading:__  

The grading will be based on the stories you produce, the work you put into them and your participation in class.

The bulk of the graded work in this class is as follows:

|Assignment|Percentage of your grade|
|----------|------------------------|
|Four enterprise stories|50%|
|Analysis notebooks|20%|
|Data negotiation|20%|
|Assignments|10%|

___Enterprise stories___: You will be required to pitch and execute four data journalism stories on your own during the semester. The stories must include original analysis of data you have obtained, a graphic or visualization of that data and a story worth publishing on NewsNetNebraska (or elsewhere if possible). Each story will be line edited and produced for online at an appointed time outside of class.

___Data negotiation___: During the semester, you will identify a database held by a government agency that you need for a story and go get it. You are negotiating for public data as a journalist, you may not promise to not use the records. Downloading data from the Internet does not fulfill the requirements of this exercise. You will be assigned a deadline for your dataset, and on your deadline day, you will give a 5-min. lightning talk about your experience along with a written report. We will discuss details in class.

___Analysis notebooks___: Throughout your analysis of data, you need to keep a running diary of what you have done -- what actions you took, commands you ran, thinking behind what you are doing. Yes, it will seem odd, but think of it like writing future you a note explaining how to do this again.

__Notes on attendance:__  

Yes, we all get sick. Yes, things happen. I don’t want you to be sick in my class any more than you want to be sick. You’ve got no fewer than four ways to get ahold of me, including my cell number. If you are going to miss class, tell me before class. We’ll work it out. But you have to tell me before class for me to help you.

This said: this class builds each class onto the next one. Miss a class and you are behind. We’re going to be covering a lot of new material in this class. Miss one at your own peril.

__Policies__

Here's the short version.You cheat, you fail, no exceptions.If I’m doing something that’s keeping you from learning, tell me. Tell the Dean. Tell someone, because that’s not cool. I won’t tolerate it from myself and you shouldn’t either.
Now the longer versions.

__ACEJMC Competencies__

After this class, you should be able to:

* Understand and apply the principles and laws of freedom of speech and press for the country in which the institution that invites ACEJMC is located, as well as receive instruction in and understand the range of systems of freedom of expression around the world, including the right to dissent, to monitor and criticize power, and to assemble and petition for redress of grievances;
* Demonstrate an understanding of the history and role of professionals and institutions in shaping communications;
* Demonstrate an understanding of gender, race ethnicity, sexual orientation and, as appropriate, other forms of diversity in domestic society in relation to mass communications;
* Demonstrate an understanding of professional ethical principles and work ethically in pursuit of truth, accuracy, fairness and diversity;
* Think critically, creatively and independently;
* Conduct research and evaluate information by methods appropriate to the communications professions in which they work;
* Write correctly and clearly in forms and styles appropriate for the communications professions, audiences and purposes they serve;
* Critically evaluate their own work and that of others for accuracy and fairness, clarity, appropriate style and grammatical correctness;
* Apply basic numerical and statistical concepts;
* Apply tools and technologies appropriate for the communications professions in which they work.

__Academic integrity:__  

Every student must adhere to the policy on academic integrity set forth in the UNL Student Code of Conduct as outlined in the UNL Bulletin. Students who plagiarize may receive a failing grade on an assignment or for an entire course and may be reported to the Student Judicial Review Board. The work a student submits in a class must be the student's own work and must be work completed for that particular class and assignment. Students wishing to build on an old project or work on a similar project in two classes must discuss this with both professors. Academic dishonesty includes:

*  handing in another's work or part of another's work as your own.
*  turning in one of your old papers (including something you wrote in high school) for a current class.
*  turning in the same or similar paper for two different classes,
*  using notes or other study aids or otherwise obtaining another's answers for a quiz or an examination.

Anything and everything you include in your papers that comes from another source must be attributed with proper citation. That includes ideas and opinions.
Plagiarism consists of using phrases, sentences or paragraphs from any source and republishing them without alteration or attribution. The sources include, but are not limited to, books, magazines, newspapers, television or radio reports, Web sites and other students’ papers.  

__Students with disabilities:__

Students with disabilities are encouraged to contact the instructor for a confidential discussion of their individual needs for academic accommodation. It is the policy of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln to provide flexible and individualized accommodation to students with documented disabilities that may affect their ability to fully participate in course activities or meet course requirements. To receive accommodation services, students must be registered with the Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) office, 132 Canfield Administration, 472-3787 voice or TTY.  

__Diversity:__  

The College of Journalism and Mass Communications values diversity, in the broadest sense of the word – gender, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, income, religion, education, geographic, physical and mental ability or disability, sexual orientation. We recognize that understanding and incorporating diversity in the curriculum enables us to prepare our students for careers as professional communicators in a global society. As communicators, we understand that journalism, advertising and other forms of strategic communication must reflect society in order to be effective and reliable. We fail as journalists if we are not accurate in our written, spoken and visual reports; including diverse voices and perspectives improves our accuracy and truthfulness. In advertising, we cannot succeed if we do not understand the value of or know how to create advertising that reflects a diverse society and, thus, appeals to broader audiences.
